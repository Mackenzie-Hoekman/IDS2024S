## First Homework  
### #1   
[README file](../../README.md)  
### #2  
The three historical types of Version Control Systems: Local Version Control Systems, Central Version Control Systems, Distributed Control Systems   
#### #3   
The best of the three historical types of Version Control Systems is the Distributed Control system because it allows for collaboration, proper file organization, security of files, and allows for the reduction of file size.   
#### #4 Briefly describe what the following git commands do.  
a. git pull = pulling the repository or files from the GitHub online storage
b. git status = the upload status of a file or repository or if it is still on the computer
c. git add --all  
d. git commit -m"latest build" = this saves the file upload and adds a note on it as it does that
e. git push --all  
  
##### Bonus Points:
1. https://mackenzie-hoekman.github.io/IDS2024S/
2. "https" means that a website will be secured if it has the "s" and the "http" allows for a web browser to communicate with a website.  
3. A relative path allows a link to other files and folders without needing the exact address so that if code is uploaded somewhere else the links will still work.
