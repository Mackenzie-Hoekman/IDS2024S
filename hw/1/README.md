## First Homework  
### #1   
[README file](../../README.md)  
### #2  
The three historical types of Version Control Systems: Local Version Control Systems, Central Version Control Systems, Distributed Control Systems   
#### #3   
The best of the three historical types of Version Control Systems is the Distributed Control system because it allows for collaboration, proper file organization, security of files, and allows for the reduction of file size.   
#### #4 Briefly describe what the following git commands do.  
a. git pull = this allows the local computer to pull the repository or files from the GitHub online storage to the local computer  
b. git status = this shows the upload status of a file or repository or if it is still on the computer, this also tells you if you still need to commit the files  
c. git add --all = this saves the file and adds the updated one back to the repository  
d. git commit -m"latest build" = this finalizes the save of the file and adds a note that says "latest build" on it as it does that  
e. git push --all = this pushes the repository using git back onto github where it can be stored online and accessed and edited by other computers with the updated version  
  
##### Bonus Points:
1. https://mackenzie-hoekman.github.io/IDS2024S/
2. "https" means that a website will be secured if it has the "s" and the "http" allows for a web browser to communicate with a website.  
3. A relative path allows a link to other files and folders without needing the exact address so that if code is uploaded somewhere else the links will still work.
