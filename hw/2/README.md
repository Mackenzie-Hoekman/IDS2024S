## **Homework 2**
1.   
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer  
3. The base functions of the compter is run on an on/off system so it could only work with integers  
4. RAM  
5. Disk/ROM  
6. a bit  
7. (A) fortran, (B) Yes, has to be converted to binary   
8. (A) Cobol, (B) 1959   
9. (A)Assembly, (B) Fortran, C, and C++ are third generation, MATLAB, Python, and R are fourth generation.  
10. C 70's, C++ and MATLAB 80's, Python 90's  
11. B  
12. C with classes  
13. C++ and ABC  
14. Registers  
15. KB  
16. fastest is 100 times faster than DRAM  
17. DRAM is 1000 times faster  
18. DRAM is 1000000 times faster than HDD  
19. Transitors control the flow of electrons, acting as a swtich or an amplifier  
20. The memory speed on the storage device affects how fast the transistors can run  
21. Fetch, decode, execute  
22. Yes, becuase a slower CPU cycle could be running more efficently and concurrently  
23. Memory access speed becuase the memory can only be acessed so quickly based on the number and efficentcy of the cores  
24.
