## **Homework 2**
1. Fortran(50s), Algol 58(50s), Lisp(50s), Basic(60s), C (70s), sh(70s), c++(80s) Fortran 90(90s), Java(90s), Python(90s), Javascript(90s), C#(2000s)  
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer  
3. The base functions of the computer is run on an on/off system so it could only work with integers  
4. RAM  
5. Disk/ROM  
6. a bit  
7. (A) Fortran, (B) Yes, has to be converted to binary   
8. (A) Cobol, (B) 1959   
9. (A)Assembly, (B) Fortran, C, and C++ are third generation, MATLAB, Python, and R are fourth generation.  
10. C 70's, C++ and MATLAB 80's, Python 90's  
11. B  
12. C with classes  
13. C++ and ABC  
14. Registers  
15. KB  
16. fastest is 100 times faster than DRAM  
17. DRAM is 1000 times faster  
18. DRAM is 1000000 times faster than HDD  
19. Transistors control the flow of electrons, acting as a switch or an amplifier  
20. The memory speed on the storage device affects how fast the transistors can run  
21. Fetch, decode, execute  
22. Yes, because a slower CPU cycle could be running more efficiently and concurrently  
23. Memory access speed because the memory can only be accessed so quickly based on the number and efficiency of the cores  
24. Denard Scaling makes devices smaller(same as MOSFET scaling), and Moores adds more switches.  
25. 1. 64 grains 2. 1,150 grains 3. 0.16 pounds  
26. 1. 9.22E18 grains 2. 9.22E18 grains 3. 1.32E15 pounds 4. 1429 years
27.  infinite random access memory, conditional execution, and some form of repeated execution  
28.
