1. data values are made into quantifiable features, ex: color, line weight, and point size and shape.
2. continuous and discrete
3. quantitative(height) and qualitative(months)
4. categorical
5. ordered(dates) and unordered(demographic)
6. Colum 1: qualitative, categorical, discrete, ordered  Colum 2: Quantitative, Numerical, Discrete, Ordered   Colum 3: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered   Colum 4: Qualitative, Categorical, Discrete, Unordered  Colum 5: Quantitative, Numerical, Continuous, Ordered
7. Only when they are the same type of information. (Ex: height vs height, age vs years)  
8. Transforming axisis are necessary when the information is heavily skewed in one direction or it follows a logarithmic path.    
9. All of them are valid. As long as it is a grid data can be placed on it and viewed. 
10. temperature or bulky data
11. Heat, ColorBrewer Blues, Okabe Ito, Blue-Red
12. Does not specific density of what, no units on density, no tittle, and the 0s are not at the same point
13. The second one as it is better for color blindness
14. [file] 5. There is a positive correlation which means that they are in the same hemispheres because they are both cold at the same time meaning they are in the same seasons at the same time.  6. They would have a negative correlation since they are in different hemispheres so they have opposite seasons.
