##  Final Exam

1. Model validation is checking that the projection or display model is correct for the data set based on testing it. Model calibration is establishing the data set and ensuring that a proper 0 is found.  
2. Data values that are made into quantifiable features, ex: color, line weight, and point size and shape.  
3. The second one as it is better for color blindness   
4.a. Qualitative color scale to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order  
  b. data values that an order, best for temperature and income  
  c. diverging color scale, data in one of two directions that has a neutral middle point  
  d. simple scale with accent colors  
5. experiment/observations, theory, and simulation/data-driven models  
6. Logical implication is not the same as physical causation because   
7.1. Visually the line of fit works because it shows the global temperature is increasing.   
  2. epistatic  
  3. positive correlation  
  4. yes, because  
  5. 0.070925267  
8. Bayesian and Classical Probability  
9. Bayesian and Classical Probability  
10. Frequentist Probability because you can not use prior knowledge or infer so since you can not pull facts of the exsitence of god this theory does not work  
11. The zeros do not align.  
12.   
13. Fortran  
14.   
15. ![photo of question](F-Q15.jpg)  
16. For A ⇒ B, when A is true B will also be true but B can be true and A not be true. So, B¯⇒ A¯ is also true becuase if A is true when B is true then if B is true, the point is in the univserse but not either circle, then A cannot be true.  
17.  dd  
18. If two Boolean propositions are equal then it means they hold the same truth statment and have the same result
