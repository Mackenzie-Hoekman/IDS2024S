1. Model validation is checking that the projection or display model is correct for the data set based on testing it. Model calibration is establishing the data set and ensuring that a proper 0 is found.
2. Data values that are made into quantifiable features, ex: color, line weight, and point size and shape.
3. The second one as it is better for color blindness
4.
  a. qualitative color scale to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order
  b. data values that an order, best for temperature and income
  c. diverging color scale, data in one of two directions that has a neutral middle point
  d. simple scale with accent colors
5. experiment/observations, theory, and simulation/data-driven models
6. Logical implication is not the same as physical causation because
7. 
  1. Visually the line of fit works because it shows the global temperature is increasing.
  2. epistatic
  3. positive correlation
  4. yes, because
